# Syllabus for Film 3: Introduction to Digital Arts and Culture (Dartmouth)

Instructor: John Bell

Based on Mary Flanagan's Film 3 syllabus

## Course Description

Digital technology is a key component of culture. Looking at popular media, science fiction, computer games, and artists&#39; projects, students will learn important approaches to digital culture including: the history of the computer as a medium; the conceptual history of interactivity; the development of film, design, extended reality, and hypermedia; the history of artificial realities; and how visions of the future may change our sense of identity and what constitutes our physical bodies.

This course will explore what it means for something to be digital beyond the reductive definition that it comes from a computer. The spine of the course will test the early promise of the Internet era–that &quot;information wants to be free&quot;–and examine how that idea has been reflected in the art and culture we have produced, where the notion has succeeded and failed, and how the tension between open and closed communities has become a key framework for participating in the digital world.

## Course Learning Outcomes

In this course, students will:

- Read, watch, and play classic and modern critical discussion on digital art and culture
- Explore the characteristics and boundaries of &#39;digital&#39; as opposed to other expressions of arts and culture throughout media history
- Analyze how digital artwork functions as a system that includes technology, individual creators and consumers, and broader social context
- Develop evidence-based theories on how digital culture has developed from the pre-computing era to today and project today&#39;s practices into the future
- Practice crafting public media and presentations that present compelling arguments to general audiences
- Hone skills for responsible community-building, including openness, respectful social scaffolding, and collaborative work toward common goals

## Teaching Methods &amp; Philosophy

This course explores digital cultures and its methods embody the practices that make up those cultures. As such, it may function a bit differently than other courses you have taken. Some examples include:

- &quot;I know Google-Fu&quot; – classroom discussions are expected to be supported by open laptops and real-time research. Obviously your laptops are already on while we're all online; I fully expect you to make use of the ability to multitask and dig up information as we talk though. Just make sure you're still paying attention to the discussion!
- &quot;Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow&quot; – all submitted assignments may be revised and resubmitted after you receive feedback (though you do need to submit a legitimate attempt at an assignment on time in order to take advantage of this privilege).
- &quot;It&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s a feature&quot; – we will undoubtably run into places where technology fails, ideas fall apart, or schedules don&#39;t work; when we do we will adapt rather than try to force our way back to the original plan.
- &quot;Good artists copy; great artists steal&quot; – we encourage reuse, remix, and derivatives of existing ideas and media, so long as it is significantly transformative and pulls together divergent threads. Note that plagiarism and uncited sources are still very much against the rules and will result in adverse consequences.

The goal of the course is to collectively develop these and other methods that encourage critical analysis, discussion, and self-reflection as both individuals and a group. Defining, evaluating, and setting these philosophies will be an explicit part of everybody&#39;s participation in the course.

## Expectations &amp; Norms

**~~Meatspace~~Zoom Participation**

This course develops a shared understanding of digital culture that will evolve as your ideas bounce off of and are transformed by others in the class. If the only time you talk is when you&#39;re giving a presentation then you will have little opportunity to contribute to the shared understanding developed by the class and I will not have much information to use when evaluating your success in the class (i.e., grade). Ask questions, throw in comments, and generally add to the discussion as much as possible, particularly if you think you missed something or you have a stupid question. The odds are good that I failed to completely explain whatever you missed and other people are as confused as you are.

You will be expected to meet with collaborators outside of class. I strongly encourage you to use the designated x hour for these meetings, but you are free to set them as needed to accommodate your schedules.

**Online Participation Beyond Zoom**

At the beginning of the class we will choose an asynchronous platform to supplement live Zoom calls–either Slack or Discord, whichever we decide we collectively feel most comfortable using.

Either way, that platform will have dedicated channels to sharing interesting and relevant resources:

- A jargon file where we will define terms and concepts that are unfamiliar
- Links to digital artwork that you find compelling in some way (or documentation if it is offline)
- Links to digital- and digital adjacent-artists, each of which is described by a brief paragraph justifying their inclusion on the list

You should add to the jargon file whenever you come across an unfamiliar term that you think needs definition. You will be expected to add at least five entries to the lists of artworks and artists over the course of the term.

**Online Class Meetings**

As part of the effort to keep everyone healthy during the pandemic, we have moved this course online. Putting the course fully online adds some extra legal and social constraints:

***COVID-Related Meeting Notice***

(1) Consent to recording of course and group office hours

-  I affirm my understanding that this course and any associated group meetings involving students and the instructor, including but not limited to scheduled and ad hoc office hours and other consultations, may be recorded within any digital platform used to offer remote instruction for this course; 

-  I further affirm that the instructor owns the copyright to their instructional materials, of which these recordings constitute a part, and distribution of any of these recordings in whole or in part without prior written consent of the instructor may be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including expulsion;

-  I authorize Dartmouth and anyone acting on behalf of Dartmouth to record my participation and appearance in any medium, and to use my name, likeness, and voice in connection with such recording; and 

-  I authorize Dartmouth and anyone acting on behalf of Dartmouth to use, reproduce, or distribute such recording without restrictions or limitation for any educational purpose deemed appropriate by Dartmouth and anyone acting on behalf of Dartmouth.

(2) Requirement of consent to one-on-one recordings 

By enrolling in this course, I hereby affirm that I will not under any circumstance make a recording in any medium of any one-on-one meeting with the instructor without obtaining the prior written consent of all those participating, and I understand that if I violate this prohibition, I will be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including expulsion, as well as any other civil or criminal penalties under applicable law.

We will discuss the implications of these rights and rules in the class as well–they are an object lesson on digital culture in their own right!

***Zoom Etiquette***
 
- Video should be on when technology allows
While it might be tempting to lurk in class, it's helpful for your professor and fellow students to see your reactions. Be present, keep video on unless an emergency comes up. It's part of active participation.
 
- Clothing is NOT optional
Remember that, even though you may be alone at home, your professor and classmates can SEE you! As a general rule, wear the kinds of clothes you would normally wear to school. While attending class in your pajama bottoms is a tempting option, you'll want to make sure that you are presenting yourself in the best possible light. The idea is not to distract from the meeting. It is always best to be prepared for a professional interaction, especially in your appearance if video will be used.
 
- We can see you being distracted
Give each other the gift of your full attention. Don’t stare at your phone, your tablet, or something else while other people are presenting. Don't cook, drive somewhere, carry on conversations with housemates/family, or visit the restroom while live in class. Remember that people can see you. 
 
- Mute is your friend
Once you log in to the virtual classroom, be sure to mute your microphone (lower left-hand corner). This will help to eliminate background noise that could distract others. Mute your audio if you are not speaking.
 
- Raise your hand and wait to be called upon.
It depends on the size of the group, but to maintain smoother transitions in a discussion, if you wish to speak, either physically raise your hand or use the "Raise Hand" button at the center of the bottom of your screen. Once the teacher calls on you, unmute yourself and begin speaking. Don’t interrupt other people when they’re speaking (or attempt to speak over them). You might also try asking questions in the Zoom chat feature, a tool to make comments and ask questions without interrupting the speaker.

**Reading**

You will be given weekly reading assignments that you will respond to and will form the core of our discussions.

**Writing Style**

Everything you produce in this course will be created as though it is targeted at the general public, whether anyone outside the course ever sees it or not. That means it is more important that you write for style, rigor, and persuasion than that you get every character of a particular citation style correct. The applicable norms are those of public humanities; unfortunately, those norms are not as well defined as more traditional academic writing. My biggest tip is that you remember that all writing, even a class assignment, is storytelling. Create a clear narrative, use concrete examples, construct an argument, add own your perspective–if you do these things, then you will be on the right path. I encourage you to ask questions about how to improve your ability to work with this style of writing and media production throughout the term, but a few resources for learning more include:

- [http://www.kellyjbaker.com/writing-for-a-public-audience/](http://www.kellyjbaker.com/writing-for-a-public-audience/)
This blog post describes some of the common mistakes people make when moving from academic to public writing.
- [https://theconversation.com/us/arts](https://theconversation.com/us/arts)
Examples of this style of writing can be found on The Conversation (though how successful each author is at employing it will vary).
- [https://workingnarratives.org/story-guide/](https://workingnarratives.org/story-guide/)
This is a bit more in-depth, but if you're interested in this kind of writing for public impact there is a more comprehensive guide here as well.

**Collaboration Policy**

You are encouraged to use outside resources, including people you know from outside the course, as research sources. All such sources must be referenced in the deliverable for the assignment you discuss with them.

Collaboration within the course will vary depending on the requirements of the assignment.

**Notes on Logistics**

- All assignments will be submitted via Canvas. Any ongoing resource sharing and discussion should take place in Slack/Discord. 
- There are several guest speakers and visitors this term. While I have tried to get a commitment from each of them for specific dates and times, we may need to adjust the schedule slightly to accommodate if a guest is not available on their scheduled date.
- I may occasionally ask to share a presentation or project outside the classroom (e.g. on Twitter). You are under absolutely no obligation to agree to this and, if you do not, I will not penalize you in any way.
- I&#39;m happy to chat about any concerns with the course or the material we&#39;re discussing. To schedule an appointment for office hours, send email to john.p.bell@dartmouth.edu

## Class Climate &amp; Inclusivity

As with all classes, it is expected that you will treat others with respect. Participation in discussion should be a constructive dialog integrating your ideas with mine and those of other students; while disagreements and counterarguments that test ideas are expected and encouraged, they must always be presented in a civil fashion. If you are repeatedly abusive toward your classmates you will be asked to leave and the day will be considered an absence for purposes of the attendance policy.

## Texts &amp; Materials

Readings will be provided in Canvas. There is no required textbook for this course, but I will ask you to read two novels this term:

- Beggars in Spain, by Nancy Kress (ISBN 9780060733483)
- Rainbow's End, by Vernor Vinge (ISBN 9780812536362)

## Assessment &amp; Grading

**Participation and Attendance: 20%**

Participation includes taking an active role in both Zoom and Slack/Discord. Remember that the topics I introduce in class are only seeds and examples; I expect you to bring in your own related interests, respond to your classmates&#39; ideas, and take our discussions and hands-on projects in directions that I can&#39;t predict ahead of time.

I will be taking attendance at each class meeting. If you are more than ten minutes late, that day will be marked as an absence. After two absences, your final grade will be lowered by a full letter grade for each additional absence. If you need to take a planned absence or will not be attending due to illness, let me know via email ahead of the class you will be missing. If your circumstances lead you to believe you will not be able to meet this attendance policy, let me know and we can discuss it.

**Commentary on Readings and Media: 25%**

You will need to create a brief response to each week&#39;s readings, media, and other ideas. These responses will be created in pairs that will be assigned during the second week of the course. Commentaries are due every Tuesday morning at 9AM, unless otherwise specified.

The form of these commentaries is up to you, though if you want to attempt a highly experimental medium or form you should check with me first. There are no guidelines for length or content, though you should keep in mind the writing style guidelines above when deciding what you want to create (even if your medium is not actually written). You and your partner are trying to explore an interesting set of ideas spanning the materials presented each week; an ideal commentary includes both insights gleaned from the week&#39;s ideas and new questions those ideas have posed in your mind.

**Deep Dive Explainer: 25%**

You will be assigned to a group that will create a deep dive presentation. Each group will present once; the presentation is expected to take roughly twenty minutes, with a few extra minutes for Q&amp;A added to the end. These explainers will go into depth on some big idea that is tangential to the topics discussed in class. Your group will need to propose a topic and, upon approval, develop a presentation aimed at general audiences.

To submit the explainer you will need to send your presentation media, speaker&#39;s notes, and bibliography to me on Canvas within a week of the in-class presentation.

**Final Project: 30%**

The final project for this course will be a ten-minute long podcast or vodcast suitable for public dissemination. By the end of January you will propose an individual research topic related to the ideas we have discussed in class. By the end of the term you will research your topic, write a script (with bibliography), and record your podcast.

To submit your final project you will need to upload the final media file, script, and bibliography to Canvas. I would also encourage you to make the media file public and will help you figure out the best distribution channel for doing so. Publication is not a requirement of the course, however–just something that I think you should do because part of participating in digital culture is actually putting your work out there for people to see.

## Dartmouth Policies

### Student Accessibility and Accommodations

Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible. Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office in Carson Hall 125 or by phone: 646-9900 or email: [Student.Accessibility.Services@Dartmouth.edu](mailto:Student.Accessibility.Services@Dartmouth.edu).

Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if you have questions about whether you qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, you should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

### Statement on Mental Health

The academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life–particularly in the middle of a pandemic. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including your:

Undergraduate Dean (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~upperde/)

Counseling and Human Development (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chd/)

Student Wellness Center (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~healthed/)

### Religious Observances

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

### Class Climate & Inclusivity
Our group will demonstrate a commitment to:
- Respect
- Civility
- Conduct
- Language
- Personal Responsibility
- Acknowledging bias (e.g. in personal viewpoints, of researchers, in course materials)
- Giving and receiving feedback

### Offensive Materials
Due to the nature of contemporary media and subject matter, this course may include difficult materials and challenging content that may prove to be offensive due to their language, visual features, theme, or overall orientation. Difficult content can be difficult to one individual and not difficult for another; this is the nature of interpretation. Such content may appear in readings, lectures, in-class discussions, screenings, software and game examples, student projects, and/or other materials. These forms of cultural expression are used as objects of description and analysis, not as promoting any view on sensitive issues. They are meant to be examined in the context of intellectual inquiry of the sort encountered at the university level. The ideas or perspectives contained or implied in such materials do not necessarily reflect the views of the professor, the Department of Film and Media Studies, or Dartmouth College. Students are invited to express their reactions to such material in class, sections, or during office hours, but they must do so in ways that demonstrate respect for other class participants and the faculty member in the spirit of intellectual and creative exploration. Students who enroll in the course will be deemed to have consented to these conditions (willingness to confront difficult or offensive material in readings, lectures, discussions, films, recordings, and other materials and to respect the rights of others).

### Academic Conduct
Plagiarism – presenting someone else’s ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words – is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Additionally, activities that give the professor an inaccurate idea of the student's skills violates the Dartmouth College honor principle.  As a Dartmouth Student you are required to comply with the Academic Honor Principle: https://students.dartmouth.edu/judicial-affairs/policy/academic-honor-principle
 
See additional information on College policies on misconduct,         
https://student-affairs.dartmouth.edu/policy/academic-honor-principle

### Honor Code Addendum

The Academic Honor Principle depends on the willingness of students to maintain and perpetuate standards of academic honesty. Students may not ask anyone other than the professor of their course to correct written work for this course. Students must rely on their judgment and conscience to determine whether a specific question might be addressed to a classmate or a friend (e.g. help with an idiom not readily available in a dictionary, or the conjugation of a rare irregular verb), but in any case, such aid must be minimal, occasional, and acknowledged. Outside proofreading/correcting changes the student's work, gives the professor an inaccurate idea of the student's skills, and as such violates the Dartmouth College honor principle. As a Dartmouth Student you are required to comply with the Academic Honor Principle: https://students.dartmouth.edu/judicial-affairs/policy/academic-honor-principle

### Dartmouth's Anti-Hazing Policy

The Film and Media Studies Department is a firm supporter of Dartmouth's Anti-Hazing Policy. We reject hazing in all of its manifestations. In order to promote a safe environment for all students and not interrupt the learning experience at Dartmouth College, evidence of hazing-related practices, as defined by the Dartmouth College Anti-Hazing Policy, will not be considered appropriate in the classroom
